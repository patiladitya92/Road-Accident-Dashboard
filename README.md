# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project is a road accident analysis tool that can be used to analyze trends and patterns in road accidents. The tool is built using Power BI and can be used to visualize data on a variety of factors, including:
## Features

- Total Casualties
- Total Accidents
- Casualties by Vehicle Type
- Casualties by Month
- Casualties by Location
- Casualties by Road Type
- Casualties by Light Condition

The dashboard can be used to identify areas where there are high numbers of accidents or casualties, and to track changes in these numbers over time. This information can be used to inform road safety initiatives and to develop strategies to reduce the number of road accidents.
